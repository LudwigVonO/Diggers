# To Do

### Replace the purely dummy data with actual factis data. 
Use postman to get a couple of movies and all their links so that I know the final format I'll be working with.

### Display films as cards V0.1
Display each film as a card showing its poster and basic recommendation info when hovering. 
When clicking, it takes you to the movie's page with more detail and more information about recs.

### Make the returned format of films more usable - V0.1
Create a couple of util functions that will automatically take the data received from GraphQL into a more easily usable object.

### Add a recommendation function V1 
A button that opens a pop-up allowing users to search for and recommend a movie. The movie is then added to the DB. 

### Sorting function -- V2
The user has a couple of drop-downs that enable him to choose how the films are displayed and ordered.
